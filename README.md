# Fade&Blade

Fade&Blade is a modern web application for a hair salon/barbershop. It provides a seamless booking experience for clients and a comprehensive management dashboard for barbers.

## Design & Development

### For Barbers (Admin Panel)
- **Dedicated Dashboard**: Access a private dashboard (`/barber/dashboard`) to manage the schedule.
- **Appointment Management**: View, approve, or cancel upcoming appointments.
- **Business Logic**: Optimized workflow for managing daily operations.

## Technology Stack
